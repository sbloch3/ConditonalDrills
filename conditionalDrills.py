#if/elif/else statement. If grade is equal to or above 80, then print "passing".
#Elif grade is lower than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, then print
#"probation". Else, print "failing". 
grade = 90
if grade>=80:
    print("passing")
elif grade<80 and grade>=60:
    print("probation")
else:
    print("failing")

#2) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if/elif statment, and if a is more
#than/equal too 100 or less than/equal too -100, print "a is a three digit 
#number". Elif a is between 100 and -100, print "a is not a three digit number".
a = 100
if a>=100 or a<=-100:
    print("a is a three digit number")
else:
    print("a is not a three digit number")

#3)Create  a variable called age. Make an if/else statement. If age is older
#than 18, print "You can vote". Else, print "You cannot vote".
age = 19
if age>18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You cannot vote")


#4)Make a string variable called answer, and set it to the letter a, b, c, or d.
#Make an if/elif statement. If answer is a, b, or d, print "Wrong". Elif answer
#is c, print "Correct".
answer = "c"
if answer is "a, b, or d":
    print("Wrong")
else:
    print("Correct")


#5)Make two boolean variables. Make an if/elif/else statement. If both booleans 
#are true, print "Both". Elif only one of the booleans is true, print "Only 
#one". Else, print "Neither".
a = True
b = False
if a and b:
    print("Both") 
elif a ^ b:
    print("Only one")
else:
    print("Neither")
